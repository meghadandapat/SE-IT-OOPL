| Assignment No.                  | Problem Statement                    |
| :-----------------------------:  | :--------------------------------    |
|[Complex.java](Assignment1/Complex.java)|Design a class ‘Complex ‘with data members for real and imaginary part. Provide default and Parameterized constructors. Write a program to perform arithmetic operations of two complex numbers.|
|[Main.java](Assignment3/Main.java)|Design and develop inheritance for a given case study, identify objects and relationships and implement inheritance wherever applicable. Employee class hasEmp_name, Emp_id, Address ,Mail_id, and Mobile_noas members. Inherit the classes: Programmer, Team Lead, Assistant Project Manager and Project Manager from employee class. Add Basic Pay (BP) as the member of all the inherited classes with 97% of BP as DA, 10 % of BP as HRA, 12% of BP as PF, 0.1% of BP for staffclub fund. Generate pay slips for the employees with their gross and net salary.|
|[Main.java](Assignment4/Main.java)|Design a base class shape with two double type values and member functions to input the data and compute_area() for calculating area of shape. Derive two classes: triangle and rectangle. Make compute_area() as abstract function and redefine this function in the derived class to suit their requirements. Write a program that accepts dimensions of triangle/rectangle and display calculated area. Implement dynamic binding for given case study.|
|[Transport.java](Assignment5/Transport.java)|Design and develop a context for given case study and implement an interface for Vehicles. Consider the example of vehicles like bicycle, car and bike. All Vehicles have common functionalities such as Gear Change, Speed up and apply breaks. Make an interface and put allthese common functionalities. Bicycle, Bike, Car classes should be implemented for all these functionalities in their own class in their own way.|
|[DisplayException.java](Assignment6/DisplayException.java)|Implement a program to handle Arithmetic exception, Array Index Out of Bounds. The user enters two numbers Num1 and Num2. The division of Num1 and Num2 is displayed. If Num1 and Num2 are not integers, the program would throw a Number Format Exception. If Num2 were zero, the program would throw an Arithmetic Exception. Display the exception.|
